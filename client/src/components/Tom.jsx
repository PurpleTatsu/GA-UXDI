      <p>ART OF CHOICE: Pen & Ink and Watercolor</p>

        <p>SHORT BIO: I have been drawing since i was a child. I can remember my mother giving me a pencil and paper to draw
      to keep me occupied in church when I was Five or Six years old. I have never lost the desire to create drawings,
      although I have gone through long periods of not creating art because of my work and life. When i retired i
      started putting more time into my artwork. I have usually worked in pencil or pen and ink. About six years ago i
      did and ink drawing of and old door on an abandoned house. That drawing sparked an interest in old structures and
      items and the use of pen and ink. Since then i have fully embraced the medium of pen and ink. My subject material
      remains old barns, buildings, farms, and objects. I am now also starting to experiment with watercolor and look
      forward to becoming proficient in that medium also. I look at my work as stated on my business card... "Saving the
      past in black and white and sometimes with a little color."
      As about the uniqueness of my work, every artists is unique even if they study the same subject. We all see and
      interpret things from our own point of view.</p>
