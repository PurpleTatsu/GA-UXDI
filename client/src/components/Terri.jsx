      <p>ART OF CHOICE: Watercolor</p>

      <p>SHORT BIO: I love color and culture and I think it shows in my art. Being in my studio creating is one of my
       favorite places to be. I have not been formally trained in art but I have been drawing and painting most of my
       life. I encourage people to replace those prints on your walls that you bought at a store with original art. It
       can be very affordable, supports an artist doing what they love and creates character in your home. Plus, you
      never know, you could be buying a real future investment!</p>
